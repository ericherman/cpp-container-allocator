@EricHerman first encountered the issue with containers not
being friendly to custom allocators requiring arguments in
the MySQL codebase:
https://github.com/mysql/mysql-server/blob/8.0/sql/auth/sql_auth_cache.h#L319..L347

@cvicentiu, helped identify the problem, consider a solution and pointed to
https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/AllocatorAwareContainer
And
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40683637/how-to-create-a-c-11-non-default-constructible-allocator
which has a link to a suggestion that microsoft has fixed this in VisualStudio:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40622430/stdlistsort-why-the-sudden-switch-to-top-down-strategy

@kms15 sat with @EricHerman to work on the actual implmentation which can be found here.
